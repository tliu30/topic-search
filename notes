A collection of reports on the progress of the algo.
====================================================

06/13/2014
----------
Tested 'initial commit' on query 'australia gold'
Evaluated
  LSI 200
  LDA 100 (on bow and tfidf)
  HDP (on tfidf)

LSI performs the best
  5 resulting topics
  3 significant (tanning, money, tourism)

LDA and HDP were both nonsensical

Seems that I need a stop list and to get rid of code parts.
